NOTE: I'm moving this project to GitHub: https://github.com/fpw/uosl/

JPhex consists of three applications:
  * JPhex Server: A server emulator for the pre-alpha version of Ultima Online from 1996

  * ViewSL: An application to browse the client's data files, such as the ingame graphics and sounds

  * JPhex Client: A client application that imitates the original client

The aim of the project is to provide an insight into how one of the first MMORPG experiences felt like.

If you want to try it out, take a look at GettingStarted.
